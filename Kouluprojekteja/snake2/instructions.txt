Snake's head is the darkest rectangle surrounded by bright red border, other body parts are coloured gradiently going brighter towards the tail. Food is depicted as bright red eclipses.

The snakes direction is changed by pressing the WASD -keys

The game has 6 difficulty settings, ranging from 0 to 5.
Difficulty affects the movement interval of the snake: interval = 1000ms - difficulty * 100ms
ranging from 1000ms to 500ms
The field height and width is also determined by difficulty: width/height = 3 + difficulty
ranging from 3 to 8.
Setting the difficulty to 5 means the snake can no longer pass through walls, and dies instead of going through to the other side of the playfield.

The snake dies if either 5 minutes has passed or the snake collided with any other body part than its tail.

After the game is over, the player is presented with information of time used and score gained. Each food eaten gives the player 50 score points. The player also has an option to either start a new game or quit playing.

Settings must be changed before the first game is started, and can be changed again after starting a new game after dying/winning.

The game can be paused by clicking the pause button, and resumed with the same button.

Player can give an rng seed if he so chooses, using the rng seed settings next to play button.
